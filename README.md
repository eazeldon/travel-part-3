# Travel project 

I’m a Graduate from Code Institute building this site to practice and grow my skills. The site is fictional.


### Concept

The project is a travel company website. The travel company is using the website to inspire site visitors to travel and want new experiences. At the same time the website is a tool for the site visitors to get ideas of different types of vacations and destinations and help them select what their next adventure will be. The fundamental purpose for the site owner is to get the site visitors to contact the site owner to book their next vacation.

### User story 

As a site owner, I want to showcase and market my business, so that potential visitors get an idea of what type of vacations they can buy.

As a site visitor, I want to be inspired and get ideas of places and types of experiences I can have during my next vacation and who I can contact and how to get help in taking my decision and making all needed arrangements. 

As a site visitor, I want to sign-up to gain access to members content and offers.

As a site visitor, I want to be able to post brief notes of my experience to help others decide on what their next adventure will be.


### UX Design

The design is intended to be straight forward, simple to navigate and understand, without any confusing elements that can distract the visitor from finding and using menu as well as finding the information they need.


### Wireframe

I used balsamiq to design my wireframe. I used iPhone, iPad, and MacBook pro views to give myself an idea of what I wanted to achieve in terms of what the site visitors will see and how it should be displayed. I’m aware of that when implementing it will not be perfect on all screens and operating systems but rather it will be a compromise. My top priority is Phone screens, followed by tablets and then laptop experience.


### Menu bar - top of page

Is in place to give easy access to the main pages of the site.


### Comments/message

The comments/message function allows the site visitors to share information about their experiences. The site owner can then pick suitable comments to post in the “Having Fun” section of the site

A comments button is displayed on the phone screen when the phone is held up right to aid the phone users. 


### Contact and Sign Up

Designed to enable the visitor to contact and email the site admin or a specific person and to be a member and gain access to member privileges. 


### Your Dream Vacations

Designed to inspire the site visitors and give tempting ideas of different categories of vacations and locations.


### Destination

The destination section is available for the site visitors to locate possible travel destinations on a map as well as to assist in finding a hotel at the chosen location and provide the hotels’ addresses.

### Having Fun

This section is designed to include video content to inspire the site visitors and post comments from site visitors sharing their experiences.

#### Video clip

The video clip is included to spark the interest of the site visitors to venture out and explore new locations by showing inspiring locations while playing music.


### Map from google

Designed to show where in the world travel locations and facilities are located.
